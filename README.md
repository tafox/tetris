Only the python version works at all right now. 
To run the python version you will need python3 and pygame. 
Both can be installed via Homebrew if you use a mac. To run
the python version type ./tetris.py. 

Things that don't work in the python version:
    - game does not end when you hit the top
    - collision detection does not work when rotating... yet, I'll fix that soon
